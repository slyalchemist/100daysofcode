# Daily Progress

## Day 8 - [09/30/2024]

### Today's Progress

- Complete module 1 of "Getting Started with Front-End and Web Development" course via Coursera

### Thoughts

- Today I felt highly motivated to get work done. I began the first course in the IBM Front-End Web Developer Professional Certificate series, and because of the motivation I was able to complete the entire first module. While I know it was a light module just going over the very *very* surface level knowledge of what's to come, the momentum has already started and I'm ready to get deeper into this development. 
- I purchased a year subscription to Coursera Plus today to further motivate me to be consistent in learning, as I don't like to waste money. Since I've got somewhat of a deadline now, my goal is to be finished with this certification within the year and be on my way to completing the IBM Full-Stack JavaScript Web Developer Professional Certification, so that I might be job hunting by October of 2025.
