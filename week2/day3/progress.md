### Today's Progress

- More lessons on Coursera
- Completed another review lesson on Codecademy

### Thoughts

- I didn't make a huge amount of progress today - I'm anticipating a late night to catch up a bit. I keep getting distracted with the idea of writing a blog to help hold me accountable and just publish my progress in another form, but I'm not sure the value of doing that in addition to these progress files. 
- Though it's good to have an understanding of the basics of computers and web browsers, these topics aren't very enjoyable to learn about and it's making me antsy to get more goding done.
