# Weekly Objective

Welcome to the weekly objectives! This file will be updated for each week to schedule my learning a little more! Some days will be scheduled heavily when I have plenty of time to study, some will be bare minimum, and some days will be lighter review days (when I already have a lot on my plate for the day).

Hopefully these documents will help me further be even more accountable, and I can go into my study sessions with objectives in mind.
