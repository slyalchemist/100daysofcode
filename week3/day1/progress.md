### Thoughts

- I did pretty well today, got a lot done and more than I had anticipated. Lately it has been kind of hard to focus with my learning, I've been finding myself somewhat distracted. Maybe it's because I've been essentially info-dumping, but I'm not the biggest fan. I think once I move into later courses on Coursera and actually have more hands-on, it'll be better.
- The Odin Project lessons still seem to be a bit of a drag. It's hard to try to process all the information from the variety of resources presented from each lesson. I guess that's mainly why I've decided to spend two days on every lesson - just to make sure I actually understand what I've learned and have the opportunity to go back with some fresher eyes. 
- I did quite a bit of LeetCode problems today - they weren't what I would call complex. They were a few of the "30 Days of JavaScript" study plan, which I guess is designed to help with learning and understanding JavaScript logic. 
- Overall, I had a pretty successful study day.
