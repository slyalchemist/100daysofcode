# 100DaysOfCode Challenge

Welcome to my journey on the 100DaysOfCode Challenge!

This repository will be host to the projects and progress from my 100 Days of Code Challenge
focused on Full Stack Web Development. 
---
This repository will be broken up into phases, followed by weeks, and finally down to
individual days. 

The folder containing an individual day will include a file `progress.md` in which I
detail what progress I made that day and my thoughts.

I will also include the sources I used to learn and any sources I may have used to help
me solve any challenges I face.

There will also be links to my work, and what my objectives are for the next day.

Each day folder will also include code snippets and other documents that reflect my progress
for the day. 

###

***Integrating #100DaysOfCode into my Study Plan***
_Commit to Coding Daily_
- Spend at least 1 hour coding or studying web development topics from my personal syllabus
- Minimum 1 pomodoro studying from The Odin Project
- Minimum 1 pomodoro studying hands-on from Codecademy
- Days with more time should be spent on more lessons from The Odin Project or 
    personal/assigned projects.

_Track Progress_
- Sharing what I've worked on daily - through this repository and quick summaries on threads.
- Posting regular updates helps me with accountability and feedback from others. 

_Mini-Projects for Practice_
- I'll set aside time within the 100 days to build small projects
- These projects will be outlined in a later section. 

_Daily Coding Tasks_
- All of my weekly objectives will be broken into smaller, manageable tasks. I will outline
    my weekly objectives in the weekly folders, and daily objectives in my `progress.md`
    files. 

_Combine Learning with Application_
- Each day I will aim to do a mix of studying and hands-on coding, as briefly stated in [1].
- If I do not have an available lesson from Codecademy to go along with what I'd learned in 
    my lesson from The Odin Project, I will practice writing small code snippets to reinforce
    what I had learned. 

_Use a Public Repository_
- To ensure my daily progress is recorded, I will track my journey on this public repository.
- This repository can also serve as inspiration for fellow programmers to follow along with
    my journey and maybe participate in friendly competition.

_Implement Rest Days_
- While this challenge is to encourage consistency and discipline, it is vital to schedule mental
    breaks and rest days.
- Lighter days can be used to review code, read documentation, or plan future projects without
    feeling overwhelmed or guilty for not making progress.

## Weekly Challenges
***In order to further challenge myself and ipmrove on specific coding skills (without embarking on yet another project), I've decided to schedule weekly code snippet challenges. This section will be simply the schedule regarding the weekly challenges. For more details regarding these challenges, please head over to the [Weekly Challenge](100DaysOfCode/weeklyChallenge.md)** 

1. String Reversal
2. FizzBuzz
3. Palindrome Checker
4. Array Chunking
5. Find the Longest Word
6. Sum of Array Elements
7. Capitalize Every Word
8. Find Duplicates in an Array
9. Remove Array Duplicates
10. Merge Two Sorted Arrays
11. Count Vowels in a String
12. Factorialize a Number
13. Find the Largest Number in an Array
14. Flatten a Multi-Dimensional Array
15. Check for Anagram
16. Sum All Primes

Many of these can be found on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)! If I decide to take on any more challenges, I will use LeetCode as a source of problems to solve. 

## Final Notes
The main reason I am embarking on this challenge is to build consistency and discipline regarding learning programming. Maybe by the time I am done with the 100 days, I might be able to start job hunting, but if not, then I just need to keep on trucking and maintain the consistency that I've established through this challenge.

As a part of this challenge, I truly hope to build a community of people around me that supports each other and wishes for success for each member. I know that as I get deeper into the challenge, the more I will be held accountable for my progress via the community I build. 

I hope that my journey on this challenge inspires many other new programmers and they embark on this journey too (and if that is the case, I'd love to hear from you!) But until then, this is just the beginning.
