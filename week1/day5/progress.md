# Daily Progress

## Day 5 - [09/27/2024]

### Today's Progress

- Completed "Library" Project from the Odin Project
    - Through this, reviewed HTML/CSS/JS and DOM Manipulation

### Thoughts

- Felt pretty good going into today's objectives. Spent a long time debugging code and going through CSS styling, which is probably the most frustrating part of all my coding thus far. I'm getting better at it but I'd like to rely less on resources (even though that might be unreasonable, it's not like I necessarily need to code an entire website from memory)
- Again, a bit out of order in comparison to `weeklyObjectives.md` but tomorrow should be catching up and getting back on track.
