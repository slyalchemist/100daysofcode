# Daily Progress

## Day 6 - [09/28/2024]

### Today's Progress

- Learned about JavaScript Classes
- Planned out further schedule of 100DaysOfCode
- Completed "Roman to Integer" LeetCode problem

### Thoughts

- Though I didn't get nearly as much done as I wanted to today, I finally got through the "Classes" lesson on Codecademy. I love Codecademy for its rather bite-size lessons with hands-on coding practice to really understand the concepts. Reflecting upon it, when I was solely using The Odin Project to learn I often found myself somewhat confused with the concepts I was learning, so I've resolved to go through the Beginner Courses of HTML and CSS from Codecademy, just to solidify any gaps I have. 
- I've been consistent this week with the project and I feel like I should celebrate, but I'm not sure how. It is gratifying enough by itself that I've been consistent in my return and even finished a project so quickly in this.
- To challenge myself a little more, I practiced a LeetCode problem titled "Roman to Integer" and figured it out correctly on the first try! I was rather proud of myself, but it was very interesting to see other methods in the submitted solutions in which the code was much, much shorter than mine.
