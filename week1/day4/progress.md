# Daily Progress

## Day 4 - [09/26/2024]

### Today's Progress

- Today I began working on the "Library" coding project from The Odin Project.
- Hands-on review of HTML/CSS and light JavaScript, DOM Manipulation

### Thoughts

- The start of this project has been somewhat rocky. I'm quite rusty on HTML and CSS, and very much still rocky on JavaScript - particularly integration with HTML/CSS. I need to review some of the more recent lessons I've done from the Odin Project to help me get better with everything.
