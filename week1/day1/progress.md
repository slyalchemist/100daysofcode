# Daily Progress

## Day 1 - [9/23/2024]

### Today's Progress

- Set up 100DaysOfCode Repository
- Filled in `README.md` for repository
- Revisited `.md` syntax

### Thoughts

- Definitely needed a refresher on how to do the syntax for `.md` files. Getting excited to be back into the swing of things. It was a light day, nothing special with regards to studying today. All I really focused on today was getting everything set up for the challenge to progress smoothly.
