# Daily Progress

## Day 3 - [09/25/2024]

### Today's Progress

- Today I reviewed the lesson "Objects and Object Constructors" from The Odin Project. The first time I went through it (probably around 4 months ago) I had a hard time understanding the lesson, but this time since I had gone through the Beginner JavaScript course from Codecademy, I had a better grasp of what I learned from the Odin Project.
- I also worked on a snippet to practice making object constructors, and it really helped solidify my understanding of object constructors. 

*Author's Note: I'm updating this the day after as I did not have time to update this file due to working late.*

### Thoughts

- I feel much better about objects and object constructors this time around. As I work with them more, I'm sure I'll have an even better understanding. 
- It's getting easier to get into the consistency and discipline, particularly since I've gotten away from the mindset of "everything needs done at once" and moved into "do what I can, whenever I have the time" and more importantly making time to do these studies.
