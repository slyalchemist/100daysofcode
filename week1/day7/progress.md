*Author's Note: Actually Completed on [9/30/2024]*

- So far I feel quite accomplished this week. I was able to get all of my weeky objectives completed and thus gives me the accomplished feeling.
- I spent some time thinking yesterday about what my career development should look like, and while the main sources I am using (The Odin Project and Codecademy) are both wonderful and very thorough together, my resume will overall look more appealing if I beef it up with a professional certification. So on top of The Odin Project and Codecademy, I've decided to undertake several courses from Coursera presented by IBM. These courses, in the order I plan to take them, (all from IBM) are:
    - Getting Started with Front-End and Web Development
    - Introduction to Software Engineering
    - Designing User Interfaces and Experiences (UI/UX)
    - Introduction to HTML, CSS, & JavaScript
    - Developing Websites and Front-Ends with Bootstrap
    - Getting Started with Git and GitHub
    - JavaScript Programming Essentials
    - Developing Front-End Apps with React
    - Intermediate Web and Front-End 
    - Developing Back-End Apps with Node.js and Express
    - Get Started with Cloud Native, DevOps, Agiles, and NoSQL
    - Front-End Development Capstone Project
    - Introduction to Containers w/ Docker, Kubernetes & OpenShift
    - Application Development using Microservices and Serverless
    - Node.js & MongoDB: Developing Back-end Database Applications
    - JavaScript Full Stack Capstone Project
    - Software Developer Career Guide and Interview Preparation
- In addition to the courses listed above, each week I intend to take on the course "People and Soft Skills for Professional and Personal Success Specialization", also offered from IBM. 
- While I don't anticipate nor expect myself to complete all of these courses within my 100DaysOfCode challenge, the entire purpose of this challenge is to establish a routine in which I spend time every day developing these skills and the discipline to study further, and what better way to do so than incorporate another resource that will further help me become career ready?
