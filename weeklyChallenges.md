## Week 1: String Reversal

**Challenge**: Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the string reversed.

**Skills**: JavaScript strings, loops, and array methods

**Bonus**: Implement it using both loops and built-in array methods like `.split()`, `.reverse()`, and `.join()`

## Week 2: FizzBuzz

**Challenge**: Write a funciton that prints numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of 5, print "Buzz." For multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz." 

**Skills**: Loops, conditionals

**Bonus**: Modify the function to accept any range of numbers as input

## Week 3: Palindrome Checker 

**Challenge**: Write a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backward)

**Skills**: Strings, loops, and conditionals

**Bonus**: Ignore spaces, punctuation, and case sensitivity while checking. 

## Week 4: Array Chunking

**Challenge**: Write a function that splits an array into groups of a specified size and returns them as a two-dimensional array.

**Skills**: Arrays, loops

**Bonus**: Implement it using recusrsion instead of loops

## Week 5: Find the Longest Word

**Challenge**: Write a function that takes a string and returns the longest word in the sentence

**Skills**: Strings, arrays, loops, conditionals

**Bonus**: Return both the longest word and its length

## Week 6: Sum of Array Elements

**Challenge**: Write a function that accepts an array of numbers and returns the sum of its elements.

**Skills**: Arrays, loops, and JavaScript array methods like `.reduce()`.

**Bonus**: Handle both positive and negative numbers.

## Week 7: Capitalize Every Word

**Challenge**: Write a function that capitalizes the first letter of every word in a given string.

**Skills**: Strings, loops, and JavaScript methods like `.split()` and `.toUpperCase()`.

**Bonus**: Handle cases where the string has multiple spaces between words.

## Week 8: Find Duplicates in an Array

**Challenge**: Write a function that finds all the duplicate values in an array.

**Skills**: Arrays, loops, conditionals.

**Bonus**: Return the duplicates in an array without any repetition.

## Week 9: Remove Array Duplicates

**Challenge**: Write a function that removes all duplicate values from an array and returns a new array with unique values.

**Skills**: Arrays, loops, and JavaScript's Set object.

**Bonus**: Implement the solution using only loops and conditionals, without using Set.

## Week 10: Merge Two Sorted Arrays

**Challenge**: Write a function that merges two sorted arrays into one sorted array.

**Skills**: Arrays, loops, and conditionals.

**Bonus**: Solve the Challenge without using array sorting methods like .sort().

## Week 11: Count Vowels in a String

**Challenge**: Write a function that counts the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in a given string.

**Skills**: Strings, loops, conditionals.

**Bonus**: Count both uppercase and lowercase vowels and return the count.

## Week 12: Factorialize a Number

**Challenge**: Write a function that returns the factorial of a given positive integer.

**Skills**: Loops, recursion.

**Bonus**: Implement the solution using both loops and recursion.

## Week 13: Find the Largest Number in an Array

**Challenge**: Write a function that finds the largest number in an array of numbers.

**Skills**: Arrays, loops, conditionals.

**Bonus**: Handle arrays that may contain negative numbers or non-integer values.

## Week 14: Flatten a Multi-Dimensional Array

**Challenge**: Write a function that takes a multi-dimensional array and returns a flattened version of that array.

**Skills**: Arrays, recursion.

**Bonus**: Implement the solution without using array methods like .flat().

## Week 15: Check for Anagram

**Challenge**: Write a function that checks whether two given strings are anagrams (words with the same characters in a different order).

**Skills**: Strings, arrays, loops, conditionals.

**Bonus**: Ignore case sensitivity and spaces.

## Week 16: Sum All Primes

**Challenge**: Write a function that sums all prime numbers up to a given number.

**Skills**: Loops, conditionals, math.

**Bonus**: Optimize your solution for larger numbers by reducing the number of checks needed to determine a prime number.
